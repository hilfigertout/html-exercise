        <h2>Cities I have lived in</h2>
        <p>I was born in Altoona, moved to Kaysville, was moved back and forth between Kaysvill and Camden, moved to Beavercreek, and all this before I graduated high school!</p>
        <p>After this, my family moved to Yellow Springs, I went to Columbus for college, and moved to Warrensburg to work at Whiteman AFB.</p>

        <h2>Cities I want to visit</h2>
        <p>Portland and Colorodo Springs both sound like nice cities to see. As for Albany, I'd love to see what the actual capital of New York is, compared to NYC.</p>
